# Probabilistic & Mathematical Enhancements

## 1. Player Scouting Relevance Ranking (Bloom Filter + Bayesian Scoring)
- **Problem:** Quickly match scouting queries to relevant players while avoiding redundant database hits.
- **Solution:**
  - Maintain a Bloom filter keyed by normalized player names and roles to short-circuit obvious negatives before querying PostgreSQL.
  - Use a Bayesian ranking model (Beta-Binomial) combining historical performance metrics (K/D ratio, ACS) with recency weighting to order candidates.
- **Implementation hooks:**
  - Extend `GET /search-players` to consult Redis-backed Bloom filter prior to SQL lookup.
  - Introduce a feature flag controlling rollout and log feature usage to analytics pipeline.
- **Expected outcome:** Reduced average lookup latency and improved precision for scouts evaluating talent pools.

## 2. Team Composition Recommendation (Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit)
- **Problem:** Static Bedrock prompts cannot adapt to roster experimentation or user feedback.
- **Solution:**
  - Implement a contextual Thompson Sampling bandit that chooses between curated prompt templates based on roster metadata, user region, and past success.
  - Use Bedrock responses as rewards (via explicit thumbs-up/down) to update posterior distributions.
- **Implementation hooks:**
  - Persist bandit state in DynamoDB/Redis, orchestrated via the `/create-team` endpoint before invoking `getTeamComposition`.
  - Add analytics events for each arm pull and reward to fuel experimentation dashboards.
- **Expected outcome:** Continual improvement in generated compositions and higher user satisfaction.

## 3. Anomaly Detection for Player Performance Streams (Streaming Z-Score + Graph Alerts)
- **Problem:** Without monitoring, sudden drops in player metrics go unnoticed until tournament failures occur.
- **Solution:**
  - Instrument ingestion jobs to compute rolling z-scores over key stats (ACS, headshot %, clutch rate) and flag anomalies beyond 3Ïƒ.
  - Model team-player dependencies as a graph and run community detection to surface cascading risk (e.g., duelists affecting controllers).
- **Implementation hooks:**
  - Publish anomalies to an event bus (Amazon EventBridge) and integrate with incident management.
  - Visualize risk propagation via Neo4j Bloom or Graphistry dashboards.
- **Expected outcome:** Early warning on performance degradation and data-driven roster interventions.

Each initiative should be piloted behind feature flags, instrumented with experimentation metrics, and tracked through ADRs to ensure transparent evolution.
