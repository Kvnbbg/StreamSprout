# ADR-001: Adopt Senior Developer Modernization Framework

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2024-06-07
- **Context:** StreamSprout operates a heterogeneous stack (Node.js, Spring Boot, Python) without unified delivery, security, or observability processes. Recent incidents with misconfigured Bedrock access and missing tests highlighted systemic fragility.

## Decision
Adopt the Senior Developer's Modernization Framework as the governing methodology for architecture, security, probabilistic intelligence, and documentation. The framework will guide backlog prioritization, design reviews, and release governance across all teams.

## Consequences
- Establishes modernization epics for CI/CD hardening, secret management, and observability as first-class roadmap items.
- Requires every architectural change to reference an ADR and attach relevant artifacts (CI configs, security policies, probabilistic models).
- Mandates quarterly reviews of modernization progress with engineering leadership, including DORA metrics and risk assessments.
- Aligns future hiring, vendor selection, and tooling evaluations with the framework's principles.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Incremental patching only:** Rejected due to lack of holistic alignment and high coordination overhead.
2. **Full platform rewrite:** Rejected because the current system delivers user value; modernization provides a safer, iterative path.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Draft supplementary ADRs for CI/CD implementation, Vault adoption, and observability stack selection.
- Update engineering onboarding materials to include framework overview and expectations.
