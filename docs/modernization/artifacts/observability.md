# Observability Enablement Plan

## Logging
- Adopt structured logging libraries (`pino` for Node, `spring-boot-starter-logging` with JSON encoder for Java) emitting JSON with request IDs, user context, and LLM invocation metadata.
- Centralize logs in OpenSearch or CloudWatch Logs with retention policies and alerting on error-rate thresholds.

## Metrics
- Instrument HTTP endpoints with Prometheus-compatible metrics (latency, throughput, error rate) via `express-prom-bundle` and Micrometer.
- Emit custom metrics for LLM usage (tokens requested, latency, failure counts) and player database operations (cache hit rate, query latency).

## Tracing
- Roll out OpenTelemetry SDKs across Node, Java, and Python services.
- Propagate trace context through REST calls and Bedrock invocations; export spans to AWS X-Ray or Grafana Tempo.

## Visualization & Alerting
- Deploy Grafana dashboards covering API health, LLM performance, and database saturation.
- Configure alerting rules for SLO breaches, anomalous LLM costs, and sudden drops in recommendation engagement.

## Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation:** Add tracing and metrics libraries, ensure correlation IDs flow through logs and responses.
2. **Aggregation:** Stand up an observability stack (Grafana, Loki/Tempo, Prometheus) or leverage AWS managed services.
3. **Optimization:** Define service-level objectives (SLOs), error budgets, and on-call alert rules aligned with modernization roadmap milestones.

Observability is integral to modernization, providing the feedback loops necessary to iterate safely and rapidly.
